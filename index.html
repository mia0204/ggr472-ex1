                    <br>Moriyama House is located in a traditional part of Tokyo where daily life continues in a typical urban structure. Forming a micro community, different volumes are independent from one another and are scattered across the site creating a series of connected individual gardens, open to the surroundings. This group of individually proportioned buildings establishes an independent landscape and atmosphere all its own, articulating SANAA’s idea that “architecture and the city are seamless”. The architecture emphasizes the coexistence of the public and private, individual and collective, personal and shared. The interior of the building also reveals the minimalist style of both the architects and the owner, Mr. Moriyama, as well as expressing the hobby, affection of rural life and craftmanship of the dwellers.
